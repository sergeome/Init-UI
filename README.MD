###Brief description of what's inside:
* Index.html with predefined basic tags

###Features
* SCSS compilation and minification to "css" folder. When compilation is finished unnecessary directories like "common" and "components" are removed. As a result in "css" folder we'll see only minified "style.css" file.
* Javascript concatenation and minification. All Javascript files from "./js/src" folder will be concatenated in "all.min.js" file and then minified.
* Built-in WebServer with livereload is included.

###How to install
* Download or clone this repo.
* Being in the folder run ```npm install``` in order to install gulp and its plugins
* In order to start server write `````gulp`````

###How to use
* Local WebServer is accessible via address ```http://localhost:8080/```
* SCSS styles should be inside ```/scss``` folder. Then you can import any scss into main ```styles.scss``` file
* JS files should be inside ```/js/src``` folder
