### How to use
* In order to start server execute `````gulp start`````

* SCSS files should be inside ```src/scss``` folder. Then you can import any scss into main ```styles.scss``` file
* Execute ```gulp dev``` in order compile JS and SCSS and leave SCSS sourcemaps. JS and SCSS wouln't be minified. Can be useful for dev purposes. This is "one-time" compilation (Without File Watcher).
