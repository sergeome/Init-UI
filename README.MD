#Starter boilerplate
###Brief description of what's inside:
* Index.html with predefined basic tags
* SCSS with empty tags defined in HTML
* Two additional predefined SCSS files like reset.scss and common.scss for appropriate goals.
* Js folder with JQuery and Bootstrap javascript files inside and of course with our future custom JS that should be added into js/src folder.

###Features
* SCSS compilation and minification to "css" folder. When compilation is finished unnecessary directories like "common" and "components" are removed. As a result in "css" folder we'll see only minified "style.css" file.
* Javascript concatenation and minification. All Javascript files from "./js/src" folder will be concatenated in "all.min.js" file and then minified.
* Built-in WebServer with livereload is included.

###How to install
* Download or clone this repo.
* Being in the folder run ```npm install``` in order to install gulp and its dependencies
* In order to start server write `````gulp`````

###How to use
* SCSS styles should be putted inside ```scss/components``` folder
